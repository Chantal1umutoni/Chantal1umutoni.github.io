After my graduate studies at African Institute for Mathematical Sciences(AIMS-Rwanda) in 2022,
I got admitted in a Post-AIMS Student program in research department where I worked as a field assistant
under a Kigali City Air Quality Monitoring Campaign. The project was about collecting the concentration of
the air and noise pollution over Kigali City. The main responsibilities were:

1. Installation, maintenance, and monitoring of day-to-day operation of air quality sensors,
2. Data collection, cleaning, and warehousing, and
3. Assisting in the design, implementation, calibration, and analysis of mathematical models.
